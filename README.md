## Wyndo

> Wyndo is a web application that allows access to a catalog of products previously registered from a POS (Point of
> Sale) by retailers. The goal is to allow Wyndo users to reserve products from inventory for purchase in a local area,
> as
> well as to provide retailers with a wider range of visibility for their businesses.

## Solution Diagram

![Solution Diagram](solution-diagram.jpeg)

## System requirements

- Python v3.11
- Postgres v15
- Redis v7.0
- Docker v23.0
- Docker Compose v2.17

## Installation

1. Create a copy of file `.env.template` and rename it `.env`

   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   > **Note**
   > Remember to check the values for each environment variable in the .env.template file (
   see [environment variables section](#environment-variables)).

2. Create a virtual environment using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module (for IDE compatibility
   purposes)

   ```
   python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Installing dependencies (for IDE compatibility purposes)

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start-up of project containers

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Running project migrations (when new migrations are created within the project)

   ```
   docker exec -it wyndo-app python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Verify at the following URL http://localhost:8000/admin that you can enter with your superuser credentials (
   see [environment variables section](#environment-variables)).

## How to send an Email

- Send a plain email

Use the `EmailMessage` class provided by Django, add the subject, message and the recipient list (it has to be a list
even when it's only one)

   ```
    subject = 'Email subject'
    message = 'Email body'
    recipient_list = ['me@me.com', ]
    email = EmailMessage(subject=subject, body=message, to=recipient_list)
    email.send()
   ```

- Send and email with a template

Use the `EmailMessage` class provided by Django just like the previous example, but it requires the template and the
object with the information we want to add to the template, after we instantiate the class change the
attribute `content_subtype` to html

   ```
  message = render_to_string{"template.html", {} }
    mail = EmailMessage(
        subject='Email subject',
        body=message,
        to=['me@me.com', ],
    )
    mail.content_subtype = "html"
    return mail.send()
   ```

## Running Celery and scheduled tasks

Wyndo contains a feature to manage scheduled tasks in the background
using [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html)
and [django_celery_beat](https://pypi.org/project/django-celery-beat/) module. By default, the inventory loading
processes from Clover and Square are scheduled. In order to test these scheduled tasks it is necessary to execute the
following commands in different command lines:

```
# Start a Celery worker service
celery -A wyndo worker --loglevel=info
```

```
# start the beat service
celery -A wyndo beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

> **Note**
> If `docker-compose` is used, it is not necessary to run the above commands. Since each has its own Docker container in
> the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## OAuth URLs for Clover and Square

- `{https | http}`://`{host name}`/retailer/signup/clover
- `{https | http}`://`{host name}`/retailer/signup/square

## Webhook URLs for Clover and Square

- `{https | http}`://`{host name}`/inventory/clover/webhook_events
- `{https | http}`://`{host name}`/inventory/square/webhook_events
